            Salt air, and the rust on your door
            I never needed anything more
            Whispers of, "Are you sure?"
            "Never have I ever before"

            But I can see us lost in the memory
            August slipped away into a moment in time
            'Cause it was never mine
            And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
            August sipped away like a bottle of wine
            'Cause you were never mine

            Your back beneath the sun
            Wishin' I could write my name on it
            Will you call when you're back at school?
            I remember thinkin' I had you

            But I can see us lost in the memory
            August slipped away into a moment in time
            'Cause it was never mine
            And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
            August sipped away like a bottle of wine
            'Cause you were never mine
